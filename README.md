# tictactoeGame

This Tic-Tac-Toe game will be executed entirely in the console, in my case I did it with Eclipse.
  
A game board of symbols will be printed and we're going to enter a number on the keywordso it'll place the X or O in the position we want and the computer will generate the X and Oin one or other spaces and we'll keep doing that until someone wins, loses or a draw.
